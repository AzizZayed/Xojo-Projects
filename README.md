# Xojo-Projects

This is a link to ALL the projects I made in High School when I first started programming. Contains games, popular algorithms like mathematical algorithms, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms and a bunch of graphics animations. I used the REALbasic programming language. A dialect from the BASIC object-oriented programming language. The software I used was Xojo: https://www.xojo.com/.
